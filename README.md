# Student Progression Outcome Predictor

This program is designed to process and analyze the academic results of a group of students. The user can input the total number of credits for pass, defer, and fail for each student, and the program will classify the student's progress as 'Progress', 'Trailer', 'Retriever', or 'Exclude', according to the credit values. The program allows for multiple sets of data to be entered and displays a histogram of the classification results for all the students at the end.
